## 📥 How to Install

### Option A: From Release (Recommended)

If you downloaded a `.zip` file generated by Lively, just **Drag and Drop** it into Lively. It will work instantly.

### Option B: From Source Code (GitHub Clone)

Lively has a strict check that prevents importing folders with existing `LivelyInfo.json` configuration files (Error: *"LivelyInfo.json file found"*).

**To install from source:**

1. **Rename** the `LivelyInfo.json` file to `_LivelyInfo.json` (or just delete it temporarily).
2. Import the wallpaper by selecting **`index.html`** in Lively.
3. Once added, **Right-Click** the wallpaper in Lively -> **Open File Location**.
4. **Close Lively completely** (Right-click Tray Icon -> Exit).
5. **Restore** the `LivelyInfo.json` file in that folder (rename it back or copy it from source).
    - *This file is required to enable the "--system-information" stats.*
6. **Restart Lively**.

*Note: If you skip step 5, the wallpaper will run in "Demo Mode" (Fake Stats) in gold text.*
